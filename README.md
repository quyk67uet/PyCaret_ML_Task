# AutoML with PyCaret

This repository contains an AutoML application built using [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/) to perform various machine learning tasks including classification, anomaly detection, clustering, and regression. The project is designed to help users easily upload datasets, explore data, train models, and download the trained models for further use.

# Task
- Classification
- Anomaly detection
- Clustering
- Regression

# Function details:
- setup: Initialize the environment and initial configuration for analysis.
- create_model: Create an anomaly detection model.
- assign_model: Assign the results from the model to the data.
- evaluate_model: Evaluate the performance of the model.
- predict_model: Predict anomalies based on the created model.
- save_model: Store the trained model for later use.
- load_model: Load the stored model for reuse.

**Make sure you are using a Python version supported by PyCaret (3.9, 3.10, or 3.11)**
